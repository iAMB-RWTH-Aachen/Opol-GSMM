## Opol-GSMM: Genome scale metabolic model of *Ogataea polymorpha*


#### Description

*Ogataea polymorpha* is a thermotolerant, methylotrophic yeast with significant industrial applications. While previously mainly used for protein synthesis, it also holds promise for producing platform chemicals. _O. polymorpha_ holds the distinct advantage of using methanol as a substrate, which could be potentially derived from carbon capture and utilization streams. Full development of the organism into a production strain and estimation of the metabolic capabilities require additional strain design, guided by metabolic modeling with a genome-scale metabolic model. However, to date, no genome-scale metabolic model is available for *O. polymorpha*.

To overcome this limitation, we used a published reconstruction of the closely related yeast *Komagataella phaffii* as a reference and corrected reactions based on KEGG and MGOB annotation.  Additionally, we conducted phenotype microarray experiments to test the suitability of 190 substrates as carbon sources. Over three-quarter of the substrate use was correctly reproduced by the model and 27 new substrates were added, that were not present in the *K. phaffii* reference model. 

The developed genome-scale metabolic model of *O. polymorpha* will support the engineering of synthetic metabolic capabilities and enable the optimization of production processes, thereby supporting a sustainable future methanol economy.
